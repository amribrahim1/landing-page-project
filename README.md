# Udacity Project: landing page project

This landing page demonstrates the use of Javascript to manipulate the DOM in the form of a dynamic navigation that uses ID's as anchors.

This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. The functionality being used serves two purposes: to append dynamically added data to the DOM, and to show how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site.
